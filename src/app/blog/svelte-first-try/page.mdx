Do you know what is the biggest scam of all time? No, it's not some crypto bros, or "make money online" deals. 

It is **mirror** (also selfie pictures. reflection overall)

Think about it. People have been using mirrors to look good to other people. But **they have never seen themselves as others see them.** Never. If you do not like what you look like in pictures but look good in mirror, that's why.

## Problem with mirrors

They flip your image horizontally.

Here's what I mean: stand in front of a mirror and raise your right hand. In the mirror, it appears to be on the right side. But if someone was standing in front of you, they would see your raised *right* hand on their *left* side. Your brain has been training on this reversed image for your entire life.

But that's not you. That's not what the world sees. Example 👇


<Image
  src="https://v1plzy848idikmzs.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Cat_reflection"
  alt="Test Image"
  caption="Top image represents what cat looks like in real life. Bottom image represents what cat looks like in mirror"
/>

## Solution
Today, we are ending it. Some say beauty saves the world. We might be helping to save the world. Ladies and gentlemen, May I present to you <br/> [True Mirror](https://mirror.roshi.ink). Website doesn't store your camera pictures or send them anywhere. It is all local. I can't afford to pay for storage services for this project. If you do not believe, I made github repo public down there so everyone can see the code. 

## Engineering 
Ok, This is not really a complex or "portfolio friendly" project. I wanted to try Svelte for the first time and see how it compares to React. And I decided to learn it by doing some fun project. Actually, that's how I learned Next.js. I built [Group 11](https://group-eleven.vercel.app) for my university group. 



### My experience with Svelte
I can't say I became professional in Svelte. But I did have fun trying it out. Especially learning experience was quite fun. In the time of building & learning, [Cloudflare went down](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/cloudflare-blames-massive-internet-outage-on-latent-bug), so AI didn't work. I didn't want to use AI to complete whole project for me anyways, but I couldn't even ask a question if I got curious about something. I did it just like old days. Googling, reading docs, and experimenting. When AI is back, I used it to make the website look cooler. I got familiar with it and I like how Svelte is closer to vanilla JavaScript. And the ecosystem around it is not bad. Overall, it was a pleasant learning experience. I might use it in the future. I might try Astro in some random weekend next time.

**I have question:**
- If the person in the mirror is not you, then you can talk to him/her, right?
