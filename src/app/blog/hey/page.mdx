# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog! This is a sample post to demonstrate the new styling. Let's explore what's possible.

## Getting Started

Here's a quick example of **bold** and _italic_ text, along with a [link to Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

### Lists are easy

- First item
- Second item with a [link](#)
- Third item with some `inline code`

### Numbered lists too

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Examples

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it to highlight important information or quotes from other sources.

## Images

![Alt text for image](/placeholder.svg)
_An example image caption_ (Note: Replace with actual image URL)

## Wrapping Up

That's it for this example! The styling is designed to be clean and readable, with good spacing and typography.
