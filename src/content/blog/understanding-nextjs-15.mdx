Next.js 15 brings a host of exciting new features and improvements that further solidify its position as a leading React framework. Let's dive into some of the most significant updates:

#### Async Request APIs

One of the incremental steps towards a simplified rendering and caching model is the introduction of Async Request APIs. This aims to make data fetching and rendering more intuitive and performant.

#### Caching Semantics Changes

With Next.js 15, `fetch` requests, `GET` Route Handlers, and client navigations are no longer cached by default. This change provides more predictable caching behavior and gives developers finer control over data freshness.

#### React 19 Support

The latest version of Next.js includes full support for React 19, bringing with it the experimental React Compiler and various hydration error improvements. This ensures you can leverage the latest React features in your applications.

#### Turbopack Dev (Stable)

Turbopack, the Rust-based successor to Webpack, is now stable in development mode. This means faster cold starts and module updates, significantly improving the developer experience.

#### `unstable_after` API (Experimental)

The experimental `unstable_after` API allows you to execute code after a response finishes streaming. This can be useful for tasks like logging or sending analytics data without delaying the user's perceived load time.

#### `instrumentation.js` API

A new `instrumentation.js` API has been introduced for server lifecycle observability, providing better insights into your application's server-side behavior.

#### Enhanced Forms (`next/form`)

Next.js 15 enhances HTML forms with client-side navigation capabilities through `next/form`, making form submissions more seamless and interactive.

These updates demonstrate Vercel's commitment to improving performance, developer experience, and the overall capabilities of Next.js. It's an exciting time to be building with Next.js!
